## This project is made to allow canteen owners to Manage customer orders and also make it easy for customers to order their desired food item

# Working:

## This project was made with the help of BlueJ and Java. Here the customers can select their favorite dishes from a list given by the software. The program works by first asking for your name. Once it has obtained that information, it proceeds to give you a list of available food items in the form of a list. The user can select an item of his/her liking. The program will display a list of multiple food items and when the customer chooses an item it will also proceed to display a list of the different varieties of the selected food item. The program then will ask the quantity the customer wants to order. Once the customer enters the quantity the program will display the total cost of the order along with the quantity and any discounts if available on screen.
